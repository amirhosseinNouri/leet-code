## [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 105
    -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
    The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
