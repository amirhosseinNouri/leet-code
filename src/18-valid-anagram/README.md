## [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-16)

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 \* 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
